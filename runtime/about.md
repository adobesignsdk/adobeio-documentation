# About Adobe I/O Runtime

Adobe I/O Runtime is Adobe&rsquo;s serverless computing platform. Based on Apache OpenWhisk, an open source project incubating at the Apache Software Foundation, Adobe I/O Runtime lets you deploy your own custom code to the cloud and call it as needed, enabling you to execute functions from the cloud without deploying or configuring a server. Thus, you get a flexible, on-demand, computing resource: function-as-a-service. Adobe I/O Runtime allows you to easily access Adobe content, data, and services, orchestrate custom workflows for your business, and respond to events from Adobe I/O Events to create powerful event-driven applications.
