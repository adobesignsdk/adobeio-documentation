# Using Adobe I/O Runtime

Adobe I/O Runtime consists of more than simply deploying individual actions and invoking them directly in the CLI. With Runtime, you can deploy groups of related actions as packages and share them with others; set up actions as webhooks so you can incorporate automatic responses to events in your applications; and access Runtime actions through the API. The following pages guide you through the process:

* [Packages](using/packages.md "Using Packages with Adobe I/O Runtime"): Bundle related actions together and share them with other developers.
* [Triggers and Rules](using/triggersrules.md "Using Triggers and Rules"): Set up triggers and rules to control actions.
* [Feeds](using/feeds.md "Using Feeds"): Configure external events to stream to triggers.
* [Webhooks](using/webhooks.md "Setting Up a Runtime Function as an Events Webhook"): Respond automatically to events.
* [API](using/sdk_api.md "Using the Adobe I/O SDK to Call Adobe APIs"): Use the SDK to access the Runtime API to integrate actions with your application directly. 
* [Debugging](using/debug.md "Debugging Adobe I/O Runtime Functions"): Learn to troubleshoot your actions.
